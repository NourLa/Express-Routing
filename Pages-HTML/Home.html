            All women deserve to be appreciated, respected, and admired. When a woman improves her appearance, an
            amazing thing happens. People begin to pay attention to her, listen to her, seek her company, ask her
            opinion. She becomes more confident, and this makes her look even better! As her confidence grows, so does
            the respect she receives â€“ at work, at home, everywhere. As her insecurity falls away, she becomes more
            daring, self-assured, courageous; she finds she can do anything. Her life improves in every way.
